```
I went out to the Twitter wood,	 
Because a fire was in my head,	 
And cut and peeled a Twitter wand,	 
And hooked a berry to a thread;	 
And when white moths were on the wing,	         5
And moth-like stars were flickering out,	 
I dropped a request in the Stream	 
And caught a little silver trout.

-WB Yeats
